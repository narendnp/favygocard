# Favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! Card

favygocard is a mini-project that aims to turn [this meme](https://i.imgur.com/7eehKJa.jpg) to somewhat be automated. Try it now at https://favygocard.narendnp.repl.co!

## How it works
The script creates an API call to search for any card that you type from its database and saves the respective card image link from it. Then it generates an image containing predefined template image with the card images that you search on top of it.

## Limitations
- For now, Desktop user can simply **_Right-click_** and **_Save image as_** to download the image, while Mobile user might need to screenshot the page.
- Search results isn't filtered by card type.

## To-do
- Add download button for generated image.

## Contribution
All forms of contribution are very much welcome! I'm currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and this is actually a byproduct of it.
