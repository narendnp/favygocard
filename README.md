# Favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! Card

favygocard is a mini-project that aims to turn [this meme](https://github.com/narendnp/favygocard/blob/master/assets/original.jpg) to somewhat be [automated](https://github.com/narendnp/favygocard/blob/master/assets/example.png). 

Try it now [here](https://narendnp.github.io/favygocard)!

## How it works
The script creates an API call to search for any card that you type from its database and saves the respective card image link from it. Then it generates an image containing predefined template image with the card images that you search on top of it.

## Limitations
- If you choose a card that has multiple artworks, it will choose the card image that has the first artwork (you can't change it).
- Search results isn't filtered by card type.

## To-do
- ~Add download button for generated image.~ (added in [09d8549](https://github.com/narendnp/favygocard/commit/30f20c1827ffaea8bec8a24c63b2f87d0e3dcb06))

## Contribution
All forms of contribution are very much welcome! I'm currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and this is actually a byproduct of it.
